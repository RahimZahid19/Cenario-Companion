But we would prefer transformer model as the Internet smaller and they're efficient and wearing generation, then doesn't generate a very stored in affected now, back to database. They're multiple Pine Cone wee8.

We can use this now you can use the you can modify the active database by segmenting, how, how there is segmented. I was names facing is required. How much chunking is required? What filters are there for them? So many things, you know,

So many things, you know, filter generator is, the generator is an LLM which which she's which uses in many stories given by the user and gives an answer according to you should wait, that's how Retrieval augmented generation system work. Okay, I also like to mention that the deadline for this cover is going to be in three weeks. So let's say it's gonna be July 10, 20 25,
