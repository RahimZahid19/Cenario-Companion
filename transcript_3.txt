So, photosynthesis is a process where plants absorb sunlight, and that sunlight is used to make chlorophyll in leaves. And that chlorophyll gives leaves the green color and also produces oxygen and oxygen is breathable by US humans. In night time, the plants absorb carbon dioxide. The retrieval augmented generation system is a system in which generation consists of three main parts: retriever, vector database, and engineering generator. The retriever is basically where documents are turned into a format that can be used by the system. The vector database stores the information from the documents, and the engineering generator uses that information to generate text. We can use this system to generate text based on the information stored in the database.

We can modify the active database by segmenting, how much chunking is required? What filters are there for them? So, many things, you know. The filter generator is an LLM which uses many stories given by the user and gives an answer according to what's given. That's how the retrieval augmented generation system works.
