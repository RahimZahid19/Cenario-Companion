The meeting aimed to plan the Flight Management app, which will allow airlines to manage flights, assign crew, track schedules, and monitor delays or changes in real-time. Key features discussed include embedding nation using a sentence transformer, using PostgreSQL and SQL for relational data, and local caching for optimization. The team decided to focus on a responsive Web app, initially mobile-friendly, with a native app option for later development. The core APIs for the app were also identified, including models for flights, aircraft, crew, bookings, and routes.
