The meeting aimed to plan the Flight Management app, which will allow airlines to manage flights, assign crew, track schedules, and monitor delays or changes in real-time. Key features and architecture were discussed, including a proposed model for flight, aircraft review, booking, and routes. The team considered using PostgreSQL for data storage, SQL for formation, and Redis for real-time notifications, such as delays or gate changes.
