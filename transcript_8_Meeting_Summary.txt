The Swift Drop Logistic Project kicked off, aiming to streamline e-commerce delivery management through a web platform and mobile driver app. The team agreed on the first milestone: creating UI/US design wireframes and mock apps within two weeks. Hakrenx will focus on dispatcher and admin views, with initial sketches due in three days. Mirza Raed will refine the dashboard and driver portal. The design should support role-based access for admins, dispatchers, and drivers, to be reflected in the backend. The team decided to meet weekly for sync-up, unless urgent changes arise.
