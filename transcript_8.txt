[00:00] Sarah (Product Manager): Thanks for joining, both of you. So let’s kick off the planning for the football app. The goal is to create a platform where users can track live scores, view team stats, and manage fantasy leagues.

[00:12] Ali (Tech Lead): Got it. Are we building from scratch, or do we plan to integrate with existing APIs for scores and player stats?

[00:18] Sarah: Good question. We’ll be using a third-party API like API-Football or Sportradar for the data feeds. That should save us a lot of time.

[00:26] Nina (UI/UX Designer): Okay, so the primary features are live scores, team and player stats, and a fantasy league component?

[00:32] Sarah: Exactly. And I think the MVP should focus on scores and stats first. Fantasy can come later.

[00:38] Ali: Actually, I’d suggest we plan the fantasy component architecture now, even if we implement it later. It can affect our backend structure.

[00:45] Sarah: Hmm, fair point. Let’s add it to the planning phase, but not include it in the MVP delivery.

[00:52] Nina: For the UI, do we have a target audience in mind? Casual fans or more serious followers?

[00:58] Sarah: Mostly casual fans, especially those who follow European leagues. The experience should be fast, minimal, and mobile-first.

[01:05] Ali: That makes sense. I’ll design a modular backend — probably Node.js with PostgreSQL. We can containerize with Docker and maybe deploy on Vercel or Railway?

[01:14] Nina: Do we want to support dark mode? Most sports apps do that now.

[01:18] Sarah: Yes, good catch. Let’s make that default, especially since users often check scores at night.

[01:24] Ali: Agreed. I’ll make sure the frontend architecture supports theming. Probably React Native or Flutter?

[01:30] Sarah: I was actually thinking of just doing mobile web at first. App stores take time to publish.

[01:36] Ali: Hmm. But earlier you said mobile-first — wouldn’t native give us better performance?

[01:41] Sarah: You're right. Let's do React Native then. It gives us a faster dev cycle and native feel.

[01:46] Nina: Okay, so I’ll start designing for React Native then. Do we have branding or logos?

[01:51] Sarah: Not yet, but I’ll get our marketing intern to work on initial concepts. Just use placeholder assets for now.

[01:57] Ali: For user auth, do we want email sign-up, or social logins like Google and Facebook?

[02:03] Sarah: Let’s do Google and Apple ID. No passwords for now — keep onboarding quick.

[02:09] Nina: And push notifications for live scores?

[02:12] Sarah: Yes — only for teams users follow. We'll need a notification preferences screen.

[02:17] Ali: Okay, summarizing the tech stack: React Native frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, and 3rd-party football API. We'll use Firebase for auth and FCM for notifications.

[02:28] Sarah: Perfect. I’ll draft the user stories by tomorrow, and let’s meet again Friday to finalize the timeline.

[02:34] Nina: Works for me. I’ll show a wireframe draft by then.

[02:37] Ali: Same here — I’ll set up the repo and start with API integration.

[02:42] Sarah: Awesome. Let’s build the best football app out there.
