**Statement of Work**

**Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to develop a text generation system using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which consists of three main components: retriever, vector database, and engineering generator. The system will be used to generate text based on information stored in a database, with the ability to modify and segment the text as required.

**Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To develop a functional RAG system that can generate text based on information stored in a database.
2. To implement a filter generator using a Large Language Model (LLM) that can provide answers based on user-input stories.
3. To ensure the system can be modified and segmented as required, with the ability to chunk and filter text.

**Scope of Work**

The scope of this project includes the following components:

1. Development of the RAG system, including the retriever, vector database, and engineering generator.
2. Implementation of the filter generator using an LLM.
3. Integration of the filter generator with the RAG system.
4. Development of a user interface to interact with the system.
5. Testing and debugging of the system to ensure it meets the project objectives.

**Deliverables**

The following deliverables are expected from this project:

1. A functional RAG system that can generate text based on information stored in a database.
2. A filter generator using an LLM that can provide answers based on user-input stories.
3. Documentation of the system architecture and design.
4. User documentation and training materials.
5. Test plans and test cases.
6. A final report detailing the development process and results.

**Timeline**

The estimated timeline for this project is 12 weeks, broken down as follows:

* Week 1-2: System design and architecture
* Week 3-4: Development of the RAG system and filter generator
* Week 5-6: Integration of the filter generator with the RAG system
* Week 7-8: Testing and debugging
* Week 9-10: User interface development
* Week 11-12: Final testing and report preparation

**Assumptions**

The following assumptions have been made for the purpose of this project:

1. The RAG system and filter generator will be developed using industry-standard tools and technologies.
2. The user interface will be developed using a web-based framework.
3. The system will be tested on a small-scale dataset before being deployed on a larger scale.

**Risks and Mitigation**

The following risks have been identified for this project:

1. Complexity of the RAG system and filter generator, which may impact development time and resources.
2. Integration challenges between the filter generator and the RAG system.
3. Difficulty in testing and debugging the system.

Mitigation strategies:

1. Breaking down the development process into smaller tasks and milestones.
2. Conducting regular code reviews and testing.
3. Providing additional resources and expertise as needed.

**Acceptance Criteria**

The following acceptance criteria will be used to determine whether the project has been completed successfully:

1. The RAG system and filter generator function as expected.
2. The system can generate text based on information stored in the database.
3. The filter generator provides answers based on user-input stories.
4. The system can be modified and segmented as required.
5. The system meets the project objectives and deliverables.
