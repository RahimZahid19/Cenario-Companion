**Time:** [Not specified]
**Sameer Uddin:** We combined the strengths of information retrieval and text generation by leveraging traditional language models that answer questions from pre-trained knowledge tracks.
**Sameer Uddin:** Our approach first retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base, which is an advanced opportunity. We then use natural language processing to craft responses.
**Sameer Uddin:** The knowledge base is a vector database or social services, and we utilize a generator model to create the final output.
